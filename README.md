# generative-circuit-boards
Processing Sketch that generates an "infinite" amount of pixel-art circuit boards

## Algorithm:
The building blocks are a cellular automaton in combination with a recursive backtracking labyrith solver, which is supplied with the target coordinates and cable guidelines. The highlighting for the wires is a post processing step.
